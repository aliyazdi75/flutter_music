# flutter_music
After some tries I couldn't find the best music player for flutter that supports both android and ios remotely and locally. The best choice that I found was audioplayer package. I biult this based on audioplayer with some more improvement.

Flutter music package within an example for android and ios, remotely and locally with notification bar status.

This example built in 2 routes that shows you how to save music states after killing the second route.
